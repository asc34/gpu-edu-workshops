There are batch scripts located in each subdirectory.  

Correct "cudascript" and "openaccscript" to add the proper batch arguments as
well as any other "module load" requirements and anything else required before
executing the executable.  Something like the following:

sed '/\#BATCHARGS/ r cudascript'  runit.nvidia-smi.inp > runit.nvidia-smi
